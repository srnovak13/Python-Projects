# Basic Python Projects
These are basic projects created as part of the Python course at The Tech Academy. They use libraries like tkinter and sqlite3. I also did several projects with Django and will provide a link below.

## Projects
- [Student Tracking System](https://github.com/srnovak13/Python-Projects/tree/main/Student_Tracking_Project)
    - A simple app created using tkinter, sqlite3, and os libraries.
    - The app provides a simple, user-friendly, way to enter names and information, store them in a database, retrieve them, and edit them in a tkinter window.
- [Move Files Program](https://github.com/srnovak13/Python-Projects/tree/main/File_Transfer_Assn)
    - A simple app created using tkinter, shutil, datetime, and os.
    - The app allows the user to choose a folder to move files from, and another folder to move files to. Once activated, the program will move all files which have been edited in the last 24 hours from the origin to the destination.

 
 ## Django Projects
 - [Checkbook](https://github.com/srnovak13/Python-Projects/tree/main/Python-Django-Projects/Django_Checkbook)
    - A simple website using Django that allows different users to pull up their account, check the balance of their account, view previous transactions, and add new transactions to their account. 
    - All transaction and account information is stored in a database.
- [Hotel Page](https://github.com/srnovak13/Python-Projects/tree/main/Python-Django-Projects/techpro)
    - A website built on Django that allows users to view, edit, and add elements to the hotel restaurant menu. It utilizes a database to store the information.
